AWS Academy Cloud Architecting 2.x - Capstone Project :

Click on the start lab.

Wait till the light near AWS to becomes green.

Click on AWS.


Steps Used to Create a project:

1. Create a database in RDS
DB Name: Example
User Name: admin
Password: lab-password
VPC- Example VPC
security group - Example-DB

*** Don't wait for the database to become available instead of doing the next steps.

2. Check security group: ALBSG, Bastion-SG, Example-DB, and Inventory-App 

3. Create a new keypair: vockey2 (ssh passthrough)
	Go to key pairs
		Name - vockey2

4. Download the PPK file 
	* Go to the Capstone project page on AWS academy.
	* On the upper right side, go to AWS details 
	*  Click on "Download PPK."

5. Create EC2-Instance Web Application. 
	
	* AMI - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
	* Instance type- t2.Small
	* VPC - Example VPC
	* Subnet - Private Subnet 1
	* Auto-assign Public IP - Disable
	* IAM role - Inventory-App-Role
	* Name - ExampleApp
	* Click on "Select an existing security group - after that, select the "Inventory App" security group.
	* Select an Existing Key - vockey2

	IMP STEP - After creating the Instance, go to Security Group - Inventory App and in the inbound rule 
		* add the type - SSH 
			* 	on the search box near the source - type -> "bastion-SG" - and select it 
		* Click on Save rules.   


6. Create Parameter Store in the System Manager
/example/endpoint - example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
/example/username - admin
/example/password - lab-password
/example/database - example

7. Access the ExampleApp via the bastion instance.
	* Open the pagent (go to the search box in your PC - search pagent - put the vockey2 key in the pagent - close the pagent )
	* Open the putty 
	* Click on connection, on the right side, "Seconds between keepalives" - 30 
	* Click on the session, and after that, on the hostname, ENTER THE IPv4 ADDRESS of the "Bastion" Instance. 
	* Go to CONNECTION-SHH-AUTH - click on ALLOW AGENT FORWARDING. Then click on "browse" and select the location of the PPK file you downloaded earlier.
	* on the pop-up, click on Accept.
	* login as - ec2-user 
	(after the above command you will see like this-> ec2-use@ip-<private IPv4 address of Bastion instance>)
	* On the command line type: ssh ec2-user@<private IPv4 address of ExampleApp instance you created earlier>
	* After that type- yes
	(after the above command, you will now log in as ExampleApp, and on the command line, you will see like this-> ec2-use@ip-<private IPv4 address of ExampleApp instance>)

8. Install the  Apache Web Server (httpd) and Mysql on Instance ExampleApp, on the command line : 
	ping www.google.com 
	click ctrl + c 
	sudo su
	yum install -y httpd mysql
	amazon-linux-extras install -y php7.2

9. Download SQL on the command line : 
	wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ILT-TF-200-ACACAD-20-EN/capstone-project/Countrydatadump.sql

10. Download the source code Web App on the command line : 
	wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ILT-TF-200-ACACAD-20-EN/capstone-project/Example.zip

11. Extract the source Web App and copy it to directory /var/www/html on the command line: 
	unzip Example.zip -d /var/www/html/
	ls /var/www/html/Example/

12. Enable and start service httpd on the command line: 
	systemctl enable httpd
	systemctl start httpd
	systemctl status httpd


13. Login to your database by using the following command line :
	mysql -u admin -p --host example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
	Enter the password - lab-password
	show databases;
	exit;

14. Import data ke database :
	mysql -u admin -p --host example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com example  < Countrydatadump.sql
	Enter the password - lab-password
	exit
	exit

15. Create a Target Group
	VPC- Example VPC
	Advanced health check setting-
		Healthy threshold - 2
		Interval - 10
	
	Tags-
		Add tag-
			Name - TG-Example
	Click on create target group

16. Create a Load Balancer
	Select Application Load balancer
	Name - LB-Example
	VPC- Example VPC
		select first region - us-east-1a
			select subnet - public subnet 1
		select second region - us-east-1b
			select subnet - public subnet 2
	Security groups 
		select - ALBSG 
	Listeners and routing-
		select - TG-Example
	Click on create a load balancer

17. Create an Auto Scaling Group
	Name- ASG-Example
	on lunch template - 
		select - Example-LT
	Network -
		VPC - Example VPC
		subnets-
			Select private subnet 1
			Select private subnet 2
	Load balancing -
		Click on attach an existing load balancer.
		select - TG-Example
18. Go to your Instances tab. Two more instances are launching; wait 2 to 3 min. to pass the checks.

19. Test the Web Application using load balancer DNS in the new tab.
	Go to the Load balancer you created earlier.
	Copy the load balancer's DNS address and paste it into a new tab.

END
