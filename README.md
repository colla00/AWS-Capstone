# AWS-Capstone-Project

This project provided the opportunity to demonstrate the solution design skills developed throughout this course. 

By the end of this project, the following architectural design principles were applied:

Deploy a PHP application that runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance
Create a database instance that the PHP application can query
Create a MySQL database from a structured query language (SQL) dump file
Update application parameters in an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
Secure the application to prevent public access to backend systems
